# Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Prediction Project
Data Project for the Professional Certificate in Data Analytics Course at Imperial College and Emeritus

Welcome to the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Prediction Project repository!

Overview:
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook Capstone-Predictive-Model-CHD.ipynb, which documents the process of building a predictive model for CHD using machine learning techniques. The project aims to leverage data-driven insights to better understand CHD risk factors and enhance prevention strategies.

Data:
The primary dataset used in this project is heart_data_project.csv, which contains various demographic and clinical variables related to CHD. Make sure to download this dataset and place it in the same directory as the notebook before running the notebook.

Running the Notebook:
To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
Open the Jupyter Notebook Capstone-Predictive-Model-CHD.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Make sure to download the heart_data_project.csv file and place it in the same directory as the notebook or change the file pathway so that it can read the data.
Execute the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the project workflow.

Note:
This capstone project serves as an exercise to practice experimenting with data and building a predictive model for CHD. Feel free to explore the notebook, modify the code, and experiment with different analyses and models.
